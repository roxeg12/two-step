# two-step
tldr: An ecommerce site for dancers and those affiliated with the dance community to sell second-hand and/or homemade dance attire and gear.

2Step Market

This website aims to fill a gap in local, underfunded, and recreational dance communities. From beginners wanting to improve their skills, to underfunded and undersupplied intermediate and advanced dancers that are well established on a team or in studios, purchasing clothes, shoes, or other gear for dancing will pose a crucial hurdle in anyone's dance journey.

This site will serve as a marketplace for current and former dancers to sell used attire such as practice clothes or costumes; for local creators to sell hand-made items such as personalized shoes or upcycled streetwear; and for current and aspiring dancers to buy necessary items at a more affordable price.
